# Interactive Navigation Menu

This project demonstrates how to create an interactive navigation menu using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The navigation menu has a fixed position, and it changes color when scrolled or when hovering over a menu item. Each menu item links to a specific section on the page, allowing smooth scrolling to those sections.
